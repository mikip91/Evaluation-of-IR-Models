# Evaluation-of-IR-Models
The objective of this project is to implement various IR models and evaluate their performance based on Mean Average Precision(MAP) values. 

A dataset containing twitter data in three diﬀerent languages(English, German and Russian), 15 sample queries and corresponding sample manual relevance were provided. 

The twitter data provided were atﬁrst indexed in Solr and then evaluated by using Trec eval program. 

The scores obtained gave us an idea of how relevant were the results given by our Solr instance.
